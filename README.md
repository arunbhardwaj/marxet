# Marxet
A platform for trading goods &amp; services

## Introduction
This project was a brief 2-week sprint where our team *completed* an MVP for an external client.

## Meet _Marxet_
While there are many platforms and websites that allow people to sell goods & services for money, the market is severely lacking a solution for those who wish to buy and sell their trade. Our solution to this is **Marxet**, an online platform on which users can trade goods & services.

On Marxet, users can create postings for the goods or services that they are willing to sell, as well as search through postings created by other users. It brings power back to the people, allowing themselves and not the "free market" to define their prices.

## Tech stack
Because we only have ten days to build Marxet, we chose to use a mix of simple  dependencies we've worked with for weeks and new technologies that are easy to use and come ready to use out of the box. 

We'll be using **React** to build the client, **Express** for our server, and **PostgreSQL** for our database. 
Alongside these, our new technologies are:
  - **Firebase** & **Auth0** for our login and authentication process
  - **MaterialUI** in conjunction with **styled-components**
    MUI is an easy-to-use styling library that has produced beautiful, modern websites- the kind of website our client has specifically requested.
  - **Next.js** for its React server-side rendering capabilities and its ability to serve static websites. It's a simple and well-documented tool for routing, as well.
  - **Docker** to keep our database environment consistent across all of our developers' local machines

## Application functionality
_What happens behind the scenes when the user interacts with it?
Where are all the places that the data travels?
What happens to that data?
How does the tech stack come together?_

## Research

## Workflow & key takeaways
_Describe your git workflow, style guides, commit guides, etc.
What did you learn from the process?
What were some key takeaways from stand-ups, code reviews, etc?
Writing tests_

We chose to use **GitHub Projects** instead of Trello boards because we prefer its integrated features, such as linking code blocks to related tickets.
