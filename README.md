# Marxet
A platform for trading goods &amp; services

## Introduction
This is the front-end for our 2-week sprint during which our team has built an MVP for an external client.

## Meet _Marxet_
While there are many platforms and websites that allow people to sell goods & services for money, the market is severely lacking a solution for those who wish to buy and sell their trade. Our solution to this is **Marxet**, an online platform on which users can trade goods & services.

On Marxet, users can create postings for the goods or services that they are willing to sell, as well as search through postings created by other users. It brings power back to the people, allowing themselves and not the "free market" to define their prices.

## Tech stack
Because we only have ten days to build Marxet, we chose to use a mix of simple  dependencies we've worked with for weeks and new technologies that are easy to use and come ready to use out of the box.

We'll be using **React** to build the client, **Express** for our server, and **MongoDB** for our database (located in another repository).
Alongside these, our new technologies are:
  - **Firebase** for our login and authentication process
  - **MaterialUI** in conjunction with **styled-components**
    MUI is an easy-to-use styling library that has produced beautiful, modern websites- the kind of website our client has specifically requested.
  - **Next.js** for its React server-side rendering capabilities and its ability to serve static websites. It's a simple and well-documented tool for routing, as well.
  - **Docker** to keep our database environment consistent across all of our developers' local machines
  - Lastly, we plan to use **AWS**'s EC2 instances to deploy our Dockerized application & database


## Technical challenges & research that you anticipated

## Technical challenges & research that were unexpected

## Video demos & walkthroughs of Marxet

## Application functionality
_What happens behind the scenes when the user interacts with it?
Where are all the places that the data travels?
What happens to that data?
How does the tech stack come together?_

## Research

## Workflow & key takeaways
_Describe your git workflow, style guides, commit guides, etc._
Our workflow is very simple-Each person works on at a time with their main tasks outlined by their tickets/issues.
Any time they've done something that noticeably changes the way the application works or looks, they _must_ commit their work thus far and describe how the application has changed.

When a significant feature / piece of functionality is completed, a pull request is made and at least 2 other collaborators will review and sign off on it before it is merged into the main `development` branch.

As for our linter configuration, we agreed early on that we would use semicolons as necessary and that our JSX files will use double quotes instead of single quotes.


_What did you learn from the process?_

_What were some key takeaways from stand-ups, code reviews, etc?_
This project has taught us that constant and concise communication is the key to efficiently building something.
We had many components and features where at least two people were working on it in tandem, which made everything from conceptualization to styling a collaborative effort.

We chose to use **GitHub Projects** instead of Trello boards because we prefer its integrated features, such as linking code blocks to related tickets.
